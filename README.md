# Spring-97
Spring-97

We try to predict numbers from 10-99 and save numbers that exist 0 times of the block of the 20 numbers of long 2 numbers. If all numbers exist not 0 times in this block save the same number that we found and all counting make zero. If the number more one exist or zero times or found number this block not compress and if 1 one time this number exist that block will be compress. Block period from 1-20. Numbers go 0-9; 0-10000. If our number is third 0-9 start from zero then it compress. Numbers go from 0-19.
